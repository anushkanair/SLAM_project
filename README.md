## SLAM for autonomous indoor navigation

This code is written to run on the mobile robot I developed to navigate around my house.
The code is organized in three parts.

### State_Machine
Python implementation of various high level robot behaviors.
E.g. State_machine/moveToTriangle.py

### Shape_tracking
C++ codebits to detect various environmental features visually using monocular cameras and depth sensors.
E.g. Shape_tracking/shapeTracking.cpp tracks a triangle with a webcam.
Video: <to add Youtube video>

### motor_controller
Arduino and C++ drivers to command motors and read encoders from the hardware platform.
