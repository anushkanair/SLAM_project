State Machine Planning

States
    1. Stopped
    2. Moving
    3. Force Stop
    4. Charging
    5. Calibrating
        a. sit in place and rotate.

Conditions
    1. If realtime != current location - force Stop and recalibrate.
    2. If obstacle is detected - plot it on the map
    3. Shape is detected at certain size - move towards it.
    4. Wall in front, too close - force stop.
    5. Shape is visible - detect. Not visible entirely - move until visible.
    6. ARtags - distance is certain length away -  Move.
    7. hasmoved() - if hasn't moved the whole distance, repeat command.
    8. hasrotated() - if hasn't rotated the whole rotation, repeat command.
    9. isstopped() - if not stop again, repeat command.

Commands
    1. Runmotors(rpm, distance)
    2. Stopmotors()
    3. Rotate(deg)
    4. Calibrate()
    5. Detect Shape size, distance, shape
    6. FindCurrentlocation() - from the different sensors.
    7. SLAM location - find
    8. Run shape tracking.
    9. Findshortestdistance()
        a. dikstra's algorithm
    10. gotoGridpoint(x, y)
        a. compute plan - high level say go from a to b.
    11. gotoNeighbor(x, y)
        b. following plan - go right, left, up, down.

Actions
    1. Move
        a. rotate degrees
        b. forward or backwards
        c. distance
        d. speed
    2. Stop
    3. Recalibrate
        a. reset sensors
    4. Calibrate
